# Immunogenicity_Prediction

“Immunogenicity” refers to the ability of a substance to induce cellular and humoral immune
responses". In layman's terms, when a foreign body enters the human body, the ability of that
body to provoke an immune response is referred to as “Immunogenicity”. It is an essential factor
during vaccine design.
